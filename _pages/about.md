I am currently a Betriu de Pinos Fellow and the Computational Lead of the Molecular Bionics Labs at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (Spain). My main research focus is the description and rationalisation of complex biological processes to aid the development of better and safer medicines. Before joining the Molecular Bionics lab I was a Research Associate in the Protein Dynamics lab at the Chemistry Department of UCL (London). I received my PhD in Physics as a Maria SÅ‚odowska Early Career Researcher within the Translocation Consortia at the University of Cagliari in 2017. 
I am an expert in multi-scale Physics-based computational methods and predictive methods for drug design.
