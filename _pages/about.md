I am currently a Beatriù de Pinós Fellow and the Computational Lead of the [Molecular Bionics Labs](https://www.molecularbionics.org) at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia ([IBEC](https://ibecbarcelona.eu)). Before joining the Molecular Bionics lab I was a Research Associate in the [Protein Dynamics group](http://www.gervasiolab.com) at UCL Chemistry (London, UK). I received my PhD in Physics as a Maria Słodowska Early Career Researcher within the [ND4BB-Translocation Consortia] (http://www.nd4bb.eu/index.php)  at the University of Cagliari in 2017. 

I am an expert in multi-scale Physics-based computational methods and predictive methods for drug design. My main research focus is the description and rationalisation of complex biological processes to deliver computational solutions for the design and optimisation of better and safer medicines.
