I am currently a Beatriù de Pinós Fellow and the Computational Lead of the [Molecular Bionics Labs](https://www.molecularbionics.org) at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia ([IBECC](https://ibecbarcelona.eu)). My main research focus is the description and rationalisation of complex biological processes to aid the development of better and safer medicines. 
Before joining the Molecular Bionics lab I was a Research Associate in the [Protein Dynamics group](http://www.gervasiolab.com) at UCL Chemistry (London, UK). I received my PhD in Physics as a Maria Słodowska Early Career Researcher within the [ND4BB-Translocation Consortia] (http://www.nd4bb.eu/index.php)  at the University of Cagliari in 2017. 
I am an expert in multi-scale Physics-based computational methods and predictive methods for drug design.
